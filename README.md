This repository contains a demonstration of a potential date format issue in an SQL query. The original query (`bug.sql`) uses a date literal ('2022-01-01') in the WHERE clause without explicitly specifying the date format. This might lead to unexpected results if the database's default date format is different. The solution (`bugSolution.sql`) demonstrates how to address this issue by using explicit date formatting or parameterized queries to ensure compatibility.
